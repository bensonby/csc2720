Install git on your machine
make a copy of the current version by:
git clone git@github.com:bensonby/csc2720.git (for the first time only)
>> this will automatically create the directory "csc2720" in the directory you issue this command

after modifying/adding any files, type "git add ." or "git add file1.php file2.php" so that they will be committed

and then type:
  git commit -m "[explanation] adding a README"

finally type:
  git remote add origin git@github.com:bensonby/csc2720.git (for the first time only)
  git push origin master

and you are done!

Next if someone else has committed their works and you have to update your own source, type:
git pull
and it will do it for you
